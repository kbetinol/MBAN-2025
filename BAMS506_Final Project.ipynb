    "* **Fractional Servings**: Since we set the orginal model decision variables as continuous, the serving size for many food items returns out to be fractions (e.g. 0.09 servings of banana), which is not practical for food consumption in real life.\n",
    "* **Food Variety and Balance** : a nutrious diet should be balanced across different food groups. Nutrients need to come from different sources of food, rather than rely on a single source of food. From the original model, 81% of Vitamin C comes from Oranges, and 79% of Iron comes from Potatos. This over-reliance on a limited set of foods makes the diet repetitive and overlooks the need for balance across different food groups, which is crucial for maintaining long-term health for students."

    " In part C, we updated our model to ensure reasonable portions, different food groups and made sure no single food item contributed more than 50% of the total value needed for each nutrient, all while minimizing total cost per serving. In our following adjustments, our focus was to expand variety within these food groups for an entire week, as kids don't like to eat the exact thing every single day. Each day of our plan is different and has varying costs per serving per day. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some other ideas were tested to add to the variety of ingredients used, but all produced infeasible or not enough solutions. For example, we attempted to restrict the number of times each food item is allowed to repeat throughout the week, however, even if the allowed repeats were lifted to 4 times a week, it still produced infeasible solutions. We then tried to enforce this constraint on only vegetables and proteins, this only produced three different meal plans, and lifting constraints incrementally did not help us reaching our goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, we were able to arrive at our final model by constricting each sebsequent meal plan to have at least 8 different food items from the previous one, and this ensured that we have enough variety throughout the week. We wanted to obtain a more diverse meal plan than our current one, however, after tightening the constraint to 9 unique food items, the mdoel only produced 6 feasible meal plans.\n",
